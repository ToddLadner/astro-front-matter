Astro is a new content focused website builder that focuses on shipping less JavaScript. In this article, we will discuss how Vue.js developers can get started with Astro.

# Introduction

Astro is a website builder that’s specifically tailored towards creating content-rich websites. It’s perfect for building a wide range of sites, such as marketing sites, publishing sites, documentation sites, blogs, portfolios, and even some e-commerce sites.

On the other hand, most modern web frameworks are designed to create web applications. These frameworks are ideal for building complex, application-like experiences within the browser.

It’s important to note the key difference between Astro and other web frameworks: Astro’s primary focus is on delivering exceptional content experiences. As a result, Astro can make specific tradeoffs and deliver unmatched performance features that wouldn’t be feasible with application-focused web frameworks.

## Partial Hydration in Astro 

Astro takes a different approach to rendering compared to other modern JavaScript web frameworks. It favors server-side rendering over client-side rendering as much as possible, which is the same approach used by traditional server-side frameworks like PHP, WordPress, Laravel, Ruby on Rails, and more. However, you don’t need to learn a second server-side language to use Astro because everything is still in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or TypeScript).

In contrast, frameworks like Next.js, SvelteKit, Nuxt, Remix, and others require client-side rendering of the entire website, with server-side rendering mainly used to address performance concerns. This approach is known as the Single Page App (SPA) model, which has its benefits but comes with additional complexity and performance tradeoffs. These tradeoffs can harm page performance, which is not ideal for content-focused websites where first-load performance is critical.

What makes Astro unique is its island component architecture and partial hydration rendering strategy. With partial hydration, developers can selectively hydrate parts of a page with JavaScript, reducing the initial load time and improving the overall performance of the site.

Astro can deliver fast and dynamic websites while still being SEO-friendly and accessible. This is a significant advantage over other frameworks that focus more on client-side rendering.

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.Getting Started with Astro for Vue Developers

The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
